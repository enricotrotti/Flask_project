The data were recorded by the \NASixtyOne spectrometer at the CERN Super Proton Synchrotron. Double-differential distributions were obtained in transverse momentum and rapidity. The mean multiplicities of \Kshort mesons were determined to be $(5.95 \pm 0.19 (stat) \pm 0.22 (sys)) \times 10^{-2}$ at 31~\GeVc, $(7.61 \pm 0.13 (stat) \pm 0.31 (sys)) \times 10^{-2}$ at 40~\GeVc and $(11.58 \pm 0.12 (stat) \pm 0.37 (sys)) \times 10^{-2}$ at 80~\GeVc. The results on $K^{0}_{S}$ production are compared with model calculations (\EposLong, SMASH 2.0 and PHSD) as well as with published data from other experiments. ');
